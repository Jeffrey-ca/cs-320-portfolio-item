How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure because I test it for most scenarios to make sure that there aren't any unexpected behavior, bugs, or errors that happen because of the code. I  interpret user needs in a program by understanding what the user is asking for and asking questions to further understand what they want. Then I take the user's needs and requirements and break them down into simple requirements that are needed to complete the bigger requirements then I program the smaller requirements one at a time to be sure that all the requirements are met. I would then test the logic of the code to be sure that the code is behaving as expected to smooth out the code and remove as many errors and bugs as possible.
